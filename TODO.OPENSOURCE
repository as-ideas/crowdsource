What is to be done to opensource this code?

- remove dependency on running mailserver (in memory-replacement via profile?)
- remove/simplify complicated test-setup (url-providers, ports aso)
- make email-templates generic and overwriteable
- make blackboxtests run (w/o docker or such)
- put stuff on heroku with example app
- deploy core (maven repo, potentially @github)
